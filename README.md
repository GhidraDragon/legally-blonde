Let me explain how this works Poki... If I could borrow index.html from another device, and well u can't stop me from replicatin' (unless u find a way, or post propaganda)

Then in theory I could follow little marco around, while borrowing index.html from whitehouse.gov in order to feed little marco some PLA propaganda while he belives he's really visiting index.html to receive guidance from Big Don 😇😇😇😇😇

Disclosure: everything factually related to Linkedin was not checked. It's not like I included the word "linkedin" more than once.

So this bot has yet to be integrated with my own logic for ML and RL gym-style exploitation; I welcome you to look at pong being rendered on matplotlib from zero to alpha, within a free Colab notebook you could clone

eggplant_emoji has found way more flaws than this, but... technically Kali Native following Little Marco around and serving my own index.html, does count towards achieving minimal operational goals.

White House notes - eggplant_emoji

Even if Nginx is directly serving the content, the header still instructs client-side caches to store the response for 300 seconds. This means that if the underlying data changes or a vulnerability is exploited within that period, users may receive outdated—or in a manipulated scenario, malicious—content. For example, if an attacker is able to intercept or influence the communication (such as via a man‑in‑the‑middle attack on an insecure network) they could inject or force a stale, tampered response into the victim’s browser cache. Additionally, if Nginx itself is using a caching mechanism (as suggested by the “x-cache”: “STALE” header), a misconfiguration or exploitation of that cache (like improper key validation) could allow an attacker to serve malicious cached content even when fresh data is available.
